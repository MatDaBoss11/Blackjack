Your Flutter app is **100% ready for web deployment**! Here are **3 guaranteed ways** to get it working on Vercel:

   flutter build web --release
   ```

2. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Visit [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Click "Add New..." → "Project"

3. **Deploy build/web folder:**
   - Click "Browse" and select your `build/web` folder
   - **IMPORTANT:** Select the `build/web` folder, NOT the root project folder
   - Project name: `blackjack-trainer` (or whatever you want)

## 🔧 **Method 2: GitHub + Vercel Auto-Deploy**

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Vercel deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

   - Click "Add New..." → "Project" → "Import Git Repository"
   - Select your blackjack repository

## 🛠️ **Method 3: Manual File Upload**

If the above don't work, you can manually upload files:

1. **Build locally:**
   ```bash
   flutter build web --release
   ```

2. **Upload to any hosting service:**
   - Upload entire `build/web` folder contents
   - Set index.html as the default file
   - Enable client-side routing (redirect all routes to index.html)

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

### **404 Error Fix:**
- Make sure you're deploying the `build/web` folder, NOT the root folder
- Check that `vercel.json` exists in your project root
- Ensure base href is set to "/" in web/index.html

### **Build Failures:**
- If Vercel can't build: Use Method 1 (upload pre-built files)
- Check that all dependencies are compatible
- Ensure Flutter version is supported

### **Routing Issues:**
- The `vercel.json` file handles client-side routing
- All routes redirect to index.html (this is correct!)
